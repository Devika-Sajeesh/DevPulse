  "ai_summary": "**Code Quality, Complexity, and Maintainability Summary**\n\nBased on the Radon, Cloc, and Pylint reports, the code quality and maintainability can be evaluated as follows:\n\n* **Complexity:** The Radon report indicates an average complexity of A (2.0), which is relatively low. This suggests that the code is not overly complex and is likely to be easy to understand and maintain.\n* **Code Quality:** The Pylint report reveals several issues, including line length, trailing whitespace, missing docstrings, and incorrect import order. The code has been rated at 4.76/10, which indicates room for improvement.\n* **Maintainability:** The Cloc report shows that the codebase consists of 2 files with a total of 142 lines, which is relatively small. The code-to-comment ratio is low, with only 8 lines of comments, which may make it challenging for new developers to understand the code.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n\n1. **Refactor code to improve readability:** Address the issues reported by Pylint, such as line length, trailing whitespace, and missing docstrings.\n2. **Improve code organization:** Consider reorganizing the code to separate concerns and reduce complexity.\n3. **Add comments and documentation:** Increase the number of comments and docstrings to make the code more understandable and maintainable.\n4. **Remove unused imports:** Remove the unused import `os` to declutter the code.\n\nBy addressing these concerns, the code quality, complexity, and maintainability can be improved, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain the codebase."
