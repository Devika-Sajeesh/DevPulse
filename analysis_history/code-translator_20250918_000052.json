  "ai_summary": "**Code Quality, Complexity, and Maintainability Summary**\n\nBased on the Radon, Cloc, and Pylint reports, the code quality and maintainability are average to below average.\n\n**Key Issues:**\n\n1. **Complexity**: The average complexity is A (2.0), which is relatively low. However, the `chatbot_ui` function has a complexity of A (3), indicating some complexity that could be refactored.\n2. **Code Quality**: The Pylint report reveals several issues, including:\n\t* Missing docstrings (module, function, and method)\n\t* Incorrect import order\n\t* Unused imports\n\t* Trailing whitespace and line length issues\n3. **Maintainability**: The code has a relatively low number of lines (142) and a simple structure, but the quality issues mentioned above may make it harder to maintain and understand.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Refactor complex functions**: Break down the `chatbot_ui` function into smaller, more manageable pieces.\n2. **Improve code quality**: Address the issues mentioned in the Pylint report, including adding docstrings, fixing import order, and removing unused imports and trailing whitespace.\n3. **Consider code review**: Have a peer review the code to identify additional areas for improvement.\n\n**Rating:** 4.76/10 (based on the Pylint report)\n\nBy addressing the issues mentioned above, the code quality and maintainability can be significantly improved."
