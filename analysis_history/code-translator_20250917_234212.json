  "ai_summary": "**Code Quality, Complexity, and Maintainability Summary**\n\nBased on the Radon, Cloc, and Pylint reports, the code quality and maintainability can be evaluated as follows:\n\n* **Complexity:** The average complexity of the code is 2.0, which is relatively low, indicating that the code is straightforward and easy to understand.\n* **Code Quality:** The Pylint report shows several issues, including long lines, trailing whitespace, missing docstrings, and incorrect import order. These issues contribute to a low code quality rating of 4.76/10.\n* **Maintainability:** The Cloc report shows that the code has a moderate number of lines (142) and a relatively low number of comments (8). The lack of comments and docstrings makes the code less maintainable.\n* **Readability:** The code has several issues that affect readability, including long lines, missing docstrings, and incorrect import order.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Refactor long lines**: Break down long lines into shorter ones to improve readability.\n2. **Add docstrings**: Include docstrings to provide context and explanations for functions, methods, and modules.\n3. **Fix import order**: Correct the import order to follow standard conventions.\n4. **Remove unused imports**: Remove unused imports to declutter the code.\n5. **Add comments**: Include comments to provide additional context and explanations for complex code sections.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the code quality, complexity, and maintainability can be improved, making it easier to read, understand, and maintain."
