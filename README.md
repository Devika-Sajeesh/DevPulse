# DevPulse: Predictive Code Health & Technical Debt Intelligence

DevPulse is a production‑grade code analysis and risk forecasting engine that combines static analysis, ML‑based risk modeling, and LLM‑powered reasoning inside a hardened, containerized architecture. Designed with modern engineering constraints in mind—security, scalability, and interpretability—DevPulse provides an end‑to‑end system for quantifying and visualizing technical debt.

This project demonstrates the ability to design, secure, and deploy a multi‑service ML system, with a focus on real‑world concerns such as sandboxing, model persistence, asynchronous execution, and full‑stack integration.

---

## 🚀 Overview

DevPulse evaluates a repository and generates a **Code Health Score (CHS)** ranging from 0–100. The score is derived from three independent signals:

### **1. Static Quality (W1)**

- Sources: **Pylint**, **Radon**, **CLOC**
- Measures style consistency, complexity, maintainability
- Normalized on a 0–1 scale

### **2. AI-Code Probability (W2)**

- Source: LLM (Groq / OpenAI)
- Estimates likelihood that the code is generated by AI
- Penalized due to potential for hallucinated logic or non‑idiomatic structure

### **3. Historical Risk (W3)**

- Source: ML model (Scikit‑learn Linear Regression)
- Predicts likelihood of future bugs or debt accumulation

The final CHS is a weighted linear combination of the three signals, built for interpretability and operational transparency.

## 🧠 Architecture

DevPulse is implemented as a **three‑service microarchitecture** orchestrated via Docker Compose:

### **1. Backend API (FastAPI)**

- Asynchronous analysis pipeline (`asyncio.gather`)
- Secure API endpoints
- Loads persisted ML model on startup
- Orchestrates sandbox execution and LLM evaluation

### **2. Sandboxed Analyzer Container**

- Runs untrusted repository code in isolated ephemeral containers
- Enforces best‑practice security boundaries:

  - Non‑root user
  - Read‑only mounts
  - Limited CPU/Memory resources
  - No persistence across runs

- Executes tools such as Pylint, Radon, Git, and CLOC

### **3. Frontend Dashboard (React)**

- Real‑time CHS visualization
- Detailed static, AI, and ML‑based breakdowns
- Modern UI with clear developer workflow

---

## 🔐 Security Model

DevPulse treats every analyzed repository as hostile. The sandbox implements:

- **Ephemeral containers** destroyed after analysis
- **No access to host filesystem** beyond read‑only mounts
- **Capability‑reduced Docker profile**
- **Resource caps** preventing infinite loops or DoS patterns
- **Optional seccomp/AppArmor hardening** for production environments

This mirrors the isolation strategy used in real‑world code‑analysis platforms.

## 📊 Machine Learning Layer

### **Model**

A Linear Regression model predicts future technical‑debt probability using features such as:

- Lines of code (normalized)
- Cyclomatic complexity
- Static quality metrics

### **Dataset**

Current implementation uses a synthetic dataset to validate ML integration and model persistence architecture. The system is structured so the model can be seamlessly retrained on large‑scale datasets (e.g., Qualitas Corpus, Boa‑derived GitHub data).

### **Evaluation**

Planned evaluation metrics:

- R²
- RMSE
- Feature‑importance validation

---

## 🧩 LLM‑Powered Risk Reasoning

DevPulse integrates LLMs not for generation, but for **risk estimation**:

- Detects AI‑like patterns (boilerplate, verbosity, unnatural structure)
- Outputs a structured JSON probability (0.0–1.0)
- Functions as a secondary, explainable risk signal

This hybrid ML + LLM approach mirrors modern code‑quality tooling.

## 🐳 Deployment

### **Requirements**

- Docker Desktop
- Python (for one‑time model training)
- Git + Personal Access Token (for private repo analysis)

### **Quick Start**

```bash
git clone <repo_url>
cd DevPulse

# Create environment variables for LLM keys and GitHub PAT
cp .env.example .env

# Train the model (creates historical_risk_model.joblib)
python ml/train_model.py

# Start API + Sandbox containers
docker compose up --build -d

# Run the frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

**API:** [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
**UI:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
